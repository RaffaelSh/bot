# Contributing

We welcome everyone to get involved, may it be a Pull Request, bug
report, feature suggestion or a spelling or wording improvement,
all contributions are valued.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is covered by a [Code of Conduct][coc] to
which all contributors must adhere.

## Reporting bugs or suggesting features

Both of these aspects are critical as they help us to improve this project
and give everyone an active voice in development.

Both can be done through the [Issues][github issues] section of the repository,
but follow a few simple standards to keep everything consistent:

- Fill out the respective template with as much information as possible.

- Include logs, if necessary.

## Contributing code or docs

Before you start, please browse the [open issues][github issues] and see if
there's a something you can work on. Contributions to issues with `help wanted`
are especially appreciated.

If you're planning to do major changes to the code, please open an issue first
to discuss the changes.

If you're adding code, make sure it is well-documented. We provide internal
documentation dedicated to developers to get a decent overview of the project.

Pull Requests should, as much as possible, be self-contained and only address
one issue. Therefore ten Pull Requests for ten small and unrelated changes are
better than one big Pull Request with everything mixed together. This way, it
is easier for us to review the changes and if there are problems with one of
them, it won't hold up the others.

After your Pull Request has passed all checks, Continuos Integration and has
been approved, it will be merged and the feature will be rolled out to our
hosted instance of the bot.

If your Pull Request is unfinished yet, make it a draft.

## Code guidelines

Make sure your code works as expeected before opening a Pull Request.

Keep everything as simple and readable as possible. Document your code to avoid
confusion and don't hesitate to ask for help on [Discord][discord].

Make sure to always run `make lint` and `make fmt` (requires `golint` and `gofmt`)
before committing your changes to make sure your code meets our quality standards.
