\<BotNameGoesHere\> is a project created and powered by the community of the [**zekro's Dev-Schuppen**](https://zekro.de/guild) Discord guild. We want to create a system which provides funny und useful features around the guild and the community - built by the community.

> This bot will not be responsible for any administrative or moderative features on the guild. Thats the area of resposibility of [**shinpuru**](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shinpuru).

## Implemenation

We decided to create the bot using the language [**Go**](https://golang.org) with the help of the Discord API wrapper [**disgord**](https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord).
